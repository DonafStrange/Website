         What are we? What is our true reality? Is what we see, understand, and feel genuinely there or could it all be an illusion? Has nature evolved on its own, or does it move under the command of hidden laws? Do we truly possess free will, or are we nothing more than small fragments in a vast, unchanging system? Is there a supernatural energy within us, or are we simply the result of chemical reactions?
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 text-justify mb-6">
         These are the kinds of questions that often cross our minds. We think about them deeply, sometimes even obsessively, yet we never arrive at a single conclusion. Science, powerful as it is, has its limits. It has not yet reached a stage where everything can be explained. And so, with these limitations, we continue to wonder. Let us then step into these mysteries, guided by the only tool we truly own, our ability to think. Thought is where it begins, for thought is the force that forever pushes us to seek, to question, and to unravel.   
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 text-justify mb-6">
         The story begins with the very birth of the universe, an event we call the Big Bang. It was the spark that brought existence into being, that gave us life, and that planted within us the desire to know the secrets of our own existence. From that single explosion came matter tiny subatomic particles, invisible forces, and energies in countless forms: heat, motion, potential, light. For convenience, let us call these building blocks “entities,” for they are the foundation of all that follows.   
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 text-justify mb-6">
         From these entities, galaxies were formed, stars were born, planets appeared, and all possible arrangements of matter and energy unfolded. And eventually, from this dance of forces and matter, something rare and fragile emerged: life. But what guided this unfolding? The answer lies in the laws of physics. These laws were written into the universe from the moment of its birth. Perhaps, in their ultimate form, they can all be gathered into one grand equation, a universal truth that explains everything in a single line. We do not yet know this equation, but perhaps one day, someone will write it. A new Einstein may rise among us.   
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 text-justify mb-6">
         For a moment, imagine that we already possess it. Imagine we can overcome the veil of uncertainty, that we can see the exact position and momentum of every particle, that we can calculate with perfect clarity the entire structure of reality. In such a vision, the universe becomes a vast problem with a solution already contained within itself, solvable, predictable, and precise. To understand this picture more clearly, let us use a single word: event. An event can be anything the tiniest flicker of a particle or the birth of a galaxy. Time itself is nothing but an endless chain of events, each one linked to the next. The Big Bang was an event. The rise of the first star was an event. And this very thought forming in your mind, right now, is also an event.   
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 text-justify mb-6">
         Perhaps the universe itself is nothing but an infinite story of events, unfolding one after another since the very beginning. And we, for a brief moment, are both the readers of this story and the characters within it. So this is what we mean by an event. Now, let us break it down further and walk into that corner of the universe where one particular event begins to take shape, the event that would give birth to life itself. There are countless possibilities here, but only some of them lead to life. Do you think life was destined to emerge, or could the universe have existed without it?   
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 text-justify mb-6">
         If we assume that everything follows strict laws of forces, energies,and  matter, then, in principle, if we possessed complete knowledge of every single detail of one instant in time, we could calculate the future. Do you see what this means? If you knew everything about one moment, you could unfold time itself, tracing every event across every line of its timeline. Doesn’t this begin to feel like a simulation? As though the universe itself could be computed, frame by frame, moment by moment? We know life exists at least here on Earth. Whether it exists elsewhere or not, we are the proof that it is possible. And if life exists here, then it must have been written into the equation from the very beginning. Every event leading to it, the formation of cells, the evolution of minds, the rise of thought, was already contained in the law.  
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 text-justify mb-6">
         Our bodies, our brains, and even the very thoughts we think are all governed by the laws of physics. At their core, they are nothing more than chemical reactions within us, and if we look deeper, they are simply interactions of subatomic particles and external entities. Our thoughts arise from the firing of neurons in the brain, which themselves are just patterns of particle interactions. If we could carry out perfect calculations of these processes, then not only could we trace the entire history of life and its evolution, but we could also foresee its future. Who will be born, who will meet whom, what they will think, what they will create, all of it, in theory, could be predicted with absolute certainty. In such a view, reality becomes nothing more than the gradual unfolding of inevitabilities. But let us pause for a moment. What do we actually mean by “life”? It is that which can think, reason, replicate itself, and advance further. Life is that which has the ability to create new forms of life, to build beyond itself if it evolves far enough. Returning to our track, we see that everything matters, energy, thought, and life arose within the same order, the same laws. And all of this was already contained in the universal equation.   
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 text-justify mb-6">
         Now, let us touch upon something closer to us: artificial intelligence. AI is, in its essence, an algorithm, a system that thinks and reasons. Slowly, it is becoming like us, and in some ways, surpassing us. AI now assists in research, creates art and music, writes words, analyzes the stock market it does almost everything humans can do. And at its heart, AI is nothing but mathematics. It is a set of rules, born from human minds, that mimics our ability to think and understand. But if we look deeper, AI itself is only the result of interactions between entities colliding, combining, evolving, all in accordance with physics. It, too, is part of the universal equation. Every event that occurs has its reason in the past. Every event unfolds because the interactions before it demanded it. These interactions obey laws, and those laws together form what we have called the universal equation.   
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 text-justify mb-6">
         So whatever happens, however it happens, wherever it happens, it happens because it must. Nothing in the universe can prevent an event from taking place, because the very elements that make up the universe are themselves responsible for making it happen. In mathematical language, all outcomes are dependent variables, bound to the conditions that precede them. So now we come to the heart of the matter. We have seen that everything that has happened, what is happening, and what will happen moves according to one law. Nothing lies outside it. The fact that I am writing these words and you are reading them is also written into this universal equation. Every living being, every thought, every action, whether we call it noble or cruel, is already part of it. Everything can be calculated, and nothing can truly be changed. Each particle of the universe, each flicker of energy known or unknown, is connected, bound together in this endless fabric of law.   
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 text-justify mb-6">
         By now, you may have realized: reality itself is an event. An event in which every entity of the universe stands exactly where it must, exactly as the equation demands. We are nothing more than the set of possible events contained within the universe, or perhaps, more boldly, the universe itself is the event. And then comes the question we cannot avoid: if everything is bound to the law, then do we truly have free will? Do we really choose? Or are we only acting out what was already fixed?   
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 text-justify mb-6">
         If someone kills, if someone dies, if someone commits a crime, if someone shows kindness, if someone resists evil, or if someone falls into it are these acts not already written? Even the moment when you stop yourself from doing something, or the hesitation you feel before making a choice, or the thoughts running through your mind right now, are they not also events destined to happen exactly as they are? Yes, they are. They will remain so, unless something interferes. Unless there is a hand beyond the law. A God. But we have no proof of God. Nowhere in the chain of events do we find evidence of such a being. If there is no God, then the fear of punishment after death disappears as well. And without that fear, the difference between right and wrong becomes uncertain. Morality becomes a matter of perspective. Some humans kill animals for food without feeling any guilt, while others, who live as strict vegetarians, see the act as unforgivable. What is “right” and what is “wrong” depends on who you are, where you stand, and what you believe. But imagine a man who does not believe in God, who is intelligent, wealthy, and free from all fear. He tortures others for his pleasure, he makes products from human skin, he rapes without guilt, claiming it as his right, just as humans dominate animals without resistance. What will you say about such a man? Will you call him evil? Or will you admit that, in the eye of the universal equation, he is neither right nor wrong, simply an event unfolding as it must?   
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 text-justify mb-6">
         So what are we then? Are we truly ourselves, or just events playing their role? Do we even have an independent existence, or do we exist only as part of everything else? Our bodies are made of atoms, and atoms are made of subatomic particles. These particles obey physical laws, just like everything else. If we could calculate every interaction inside the body, along with every influence from outside, then the future evolution of that body could also be known. What it will do, what it will think, who it will meet, how it will look, all of it could be predicted. In such a case, nothing we do is truly our own. Everything is already fixed, as it is governed by the unchanging laws of physics. Unless… unless there exists within us something beyond the reach of physical law. Unless there is a hidden variable independent, untouched, that can bend or break the equation. If such an energy exists, then life is more than calculation. Then the universe is not fully deterministic, but chaotic and alive. In simple words, there must be an Operator, something that stands outside the equation yet moves within it. And so I leave you here, with these questions. Let them follow you into your dreams. Sometimes, the sweetest sleep is the one haunted by thoughts too vast to answer.   
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 text-justify mb-6">
         So, do we still believe that in reality there exists good and bad, joy and sorrow, right and wrong, truth and falsehood, evil and its opposite, or even that our very thoughts truly exist? If yes, then perhaps it’s time to pause and ask: why? Because in reality, everything is nothing more than an event unfolding under the laws of physics, the very same laws that govern the past, present, and future of the universe.
